# ViewTransitionSwift
This is a Swift 3 version of the ViewTransitions sample project found at: https://developer.apple.com/library/content/samplecode/ViewTransitions/Introduction/Intro.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/DTS40007411

The original is written in Objective-C. This one is Swift 3.1. There are some very minor differences, but I generally tried
not to change anything other than language.
